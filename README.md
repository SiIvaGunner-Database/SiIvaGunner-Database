# SiIvaGunner Database

[siivagunnerdatabase.net](http://siivagunnerdatabase.net/) is a dynamic HTML5 web application built with Django that runs on Google Cloud Run and Google Cloud SQL. It contains video data that can searched and sorted through.

### Local Development

Requires an active [Django development environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/development_environment). Start by navigating into ```cloudrun/siivagunnerdb/```. Then use the following command to run locally. Currently, the project requires credentials to run locally, but I plan on fixing this in the future.

    python manage.py runserver
